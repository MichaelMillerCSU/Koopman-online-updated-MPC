# Koopman-online-updated-MPC

# Code and Data for paper "Learning Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems with Time-varying Parameters Using Koopman Operator"

Run duffing.py and vanderpol.py can generate the figures in the paper.

The training file is DeepLearning_KoopmanControl_Approach3.py.

pkl files are the parameters of \theta_D and \theta_E of duffing system and van der pol system for different systems.

New example Cascaded Tank System is added.

The parameters of theta_D and \theta_E are transfer to mat file in Weights folder

An One-dimensional system example is added, with lifted function trained by KMAE.
