# Koopman-online-updated-MPC

Run duffing.py and vanderpol.py can generate the figures in the paper.

The training file is DeepLearning_KoopmanControl_Approach3.py.

pkl files are the parameters of \theta_D and \theta_E for different systems.

Plot.m is the tool to plot data collected in .m files, but the figures shown in the paper are edited in matlab plot tools (legend, xlabel, .etc)
